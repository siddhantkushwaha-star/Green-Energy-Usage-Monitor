Project Name: Green Energy Usage Monitor
Industry: GreenTech / Renewable Energy
Objective: Empower users to track solar energy generation, savings, and CO₂ reduction with real-time data via Salesforce CRM.

Requirement Gathering
Pain Point: Solar customers lack insights into energy production, cost savings, and green impact. Manual logs and delayed feedback risk poor ROI and dissatisfaction.

Compelling Requirements:

Track daily, weekly, and monthly solar energy generation automatically.

Calculate utility bill savings and quantify CO₂ reduction.

Real-time notifications for performance drops—enabling proactive maintenance.

Dashboard for comparison (across locations, time), goal setting, and achievement alerts.

Stakeholder Analysis
Solar Customers: Homeowners and companies aiming for green savings.

Solar Providers/Sales Agents: Need automated lead scoring, installation status, and satisfaction tracking.

Technicians: Require instant alerts for underperforming panels.

Administrators/Managers: Demand portfolio-wide performance analytics and compliance metrics.

Business Process Mapping
Lead Capture: From web/social, qualified by customer’s interest in green solutions.

Solar Panel Purchase/Installation: Request → Approval → Scheduling → Installation.

Energy Logging: IoT/Manual log → validation → savings computation.

Support & Maintenance: Performance drop triggers support workflow.

Reporting & Insights: Queries, dashboards, monthly savings reports.

Industry-specific Use Case Analysis
GreenTech Focus: Unlike generic CRM projects, tackles trending sustainability and smart energy domains.

Innovation Angle:

Integration of IoT data for real-time solar performance.

Automated energy insights attracts eco-conscious users, driving market differentiation.

AppExchange Exploration
Existing Apps Reviewed: Studied “Energy Management Cloud” and similar, identifying gaps like lack of granular, per-customer reports and notifications.

Rationale for Build: Custom solution enables unique workflows—automated energy logs, predictive performance alerts, and high-impact dashboards, tuned for Indian and global audiences.
